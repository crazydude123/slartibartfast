Natural disasters are painful. Epidemics create havoc. Our intention is to create a web-app that allows documentation of ailments and diseases from the affected people first-hand. The web-app adds credits as remuneration for legitimate information from the patient. Every user in a 100 m^2 radius is alerted about a serious disease. Those reporting without having consulted a doctor are matched to a possible disease and are advised to immediately consult a doctor.
